# Project 1: Real-time filtering
This is Project 1: Real-time filtering by Yixiang Xie for CS5330 Pattern Recognition & Computer Vision.

The code is written in C++ with OpenCV4 on Visual Studio Code on macOS Sonoma 14.0 and compiled with a CMakeLists.txt file.

# Run the code
In order to run the code, use command line to run the bash script by ```./run.sh```.

# Extensions
For extensions, I explored and compared 6 different ways of implementing gray scale filter: using red channel, blue channel, green channel, average of the three channels, value channel from HSV and L channel from Lab. These filters can be accessed by pressing key 1-6 after code is running.

In addition to allowing user increase or decrease brightness by pressing key up or down, I also allow the user to increase or decrease contrast by pressing key right or left.
